# TODO: Fix Mobile Scrolling Issue in EventPage

- [x] Edit src/styles/EventPage.css to enable vertical scrolling on mobile by adding `overflow-y: auto` to `.eventpage` in the `@media (max-width: 768px)` query.
- [x] Update touch navigation in EventPage.jsx to distinguish between horizontal swipes (for carousel) and vertical scrolls (for page scrolling).
- [x] Test the page on a mobile device or emulator to ensure content is scrollable and accessible.
